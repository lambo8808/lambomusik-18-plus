## 2024-08-17 - Vercel Analytics Dynamic Import Optimization
**Learning:** Loading `@vercel/analytics` synchronously in `main.js` causes the bundle size of the initial chunk to be bloated, potentially delaying the main application logic and blocking the main thread during initialization.
**Action:** Replace synchronous import of third-party analytics (like `@vercel/analytics`) with dynamic import (`import().then()`) so it's loaded asynchronously, improving initial page load speed.
